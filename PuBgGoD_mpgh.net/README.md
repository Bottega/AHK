hello, i have made this macro for myself but i will share with u guys =)

all you need is just open and start configuring your recoil and ms.

FEATURES;

*HotKey for each weapon
*HotKeys for each function
*Auto move ( Recoil and MS option )
*Single mode (Cadence and MS option )
*Top most option
*Transparence 

MS = Time for the script to move down ur mouse
Recoil = size of Movement to go down
so right ms and small recoil will show slower down and small MS and right recoil will do a big jump down based on your MS

so MS means = Milliseconds
