:CROUCH JUMP OPTIMIZATION: *shoutout to @FxOxAxD

Hold "Spacebar" a bit longer to crouch jump

Tap "Spacebar" really short to normal jump

:ABILITY TO CHANGES VALUES FOR MOUSE SLEEPTIME:

PageUp to add

PageDown to subtract

:REMOVED:

TimeSwitch feature has been removed (because it sucks! and nobody gets it, so as me)

:BINDS:

No binds needed for Weapon1, Weapon2, Melee, SideArm and Throwables ... etc, remove the secondaries if you still have it

Only bind F3 as your secondary Jump key

Make sure F1 and F2 are not binded to anything because they are your LoadOut types

Changelog (v3.1)

:FIXED:

Swimming Up

:BINDS:

F3 binds to secondary jump key

F4 binds to secondary crouch key (NEW!)
