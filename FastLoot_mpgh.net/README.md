 Fast Loot (Config for all resolutions)

    This is a fast loot script based on the one that "lefkas" posted before, but improved.
    Now with a configuration for all resolutions, since the last one seems to not work for all resolutions.

Tutorial

1 - Download the files.

2 - at first open the "[CONFIG SCRIPT] RUN ME FIRST.exe". you will need to use it only in the first time.

3 - in your game press "tab"

4 - remove at least 4 items of your inventory

5 - put your mouse pointer on the middle of each item and press numpad1 for item 1, numpad2 for item 2... until item 4.
you will be setting the position of each item

6 - now you need to set your inventory position, aim at your character's head in tab menu and press numpad5 to save his head position.

7 - Done! it's all configured. just press "del" to close the script and run "[FAST LOOT] RUN ME.exe".
