INFO

You need Auto Hotkey to run this script, once installed, download pubg-ahk-helper.ahk and you should be able to run it.

Please set Screen Mode to Window or Windowed Fullscreen, it wont work on FullScreen.

It'll show you a tooltip under your crosshair whenever you enable/disable or change a value of a module. Tooltips are working for all resolutions.

You can toggle Pause/Play script with Pause Button (Yes, there is a button for that) Although it only works if PUBG is your active window and the cursor is not visible (e.g. inventory, map... so you can drag items, mark locations, etc)

ADS (Fast Aiming)

You'll be able to aim from the ads while holding right click instead of clicking twice. If enabled, clicks once and clicks again when button is released. If not, just keeps holding until button is released.
[Toggle: Mouse 5 Button]

Crouch Jump

Crouch jumping, aka super jump, before you had to press Space and C exactly at the same time, that makes it quite difficult... With this script you can jump normally with single Space press, and super jump if you press and hold Space. So, single press = normal jump, hold space = super jump. Also keeps crouching 0.5 seconds to improve the jump. This will be useful at least until vaulting is released.

AutoFire

It'll allow you to shot in Full Auto mode for all semi automatic weapons (e.g. M16, SKS, Mini-14 and Pistols) Only works while holding aim (holding right click) so you'll be able to throw grenades.

Compensation

Moves the mouse down to compensate recoil, by default is set to 8, which is optimal for short/mid range. Also it only works while holding aim, to allow you throw grenades properly.
